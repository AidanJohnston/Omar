/**
* The <code> AbstractConnectionFactory </code> is an abstract class

* The role of this class is to create these connections
* when required. The creation of such factory is however
* optional.<p>
*
* A factory and the corresponding client connections
* should be defined when one to handle the received
* messages inside each <code>ConnectionToClient</code>
* instances instead of having a centralized handling
* through the 
* <code>AbstractServer.handleMessageFromClient()</code>
* method.
