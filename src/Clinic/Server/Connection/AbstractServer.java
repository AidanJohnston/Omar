/**
* The <code> AbstractServer </code> class maintains a thread that waits
* for connection attempts from clients. When a connection attempt occurs
* it creates a new <code> ConnectionToClient </code> instance which
* runs as a thread. When a client is thus connected to the
* server, the two programs can then exchange <code> Object </code>
* instances.<p>
*
* Method <code> handleMessageFromClient </code> must be defined by
* a concrete subclass. Several other hook methods may also be
* overriden.<p>
*
* Several public service methods are provided to applications that use
* this framework, and several hook methods are also available<p>
*
* The modifications made to this class in version 2.2 are:
* <ul>
* <li> The synchronization of the <code>close()</code> method
* is now limited to the client threads closing sequence. The
* call to <code>serverClosed()</code> is outside the synchronized
* block and is preceeded by a join that garantees that
* <code>serverStopped()</code> is always called before.
* <li> Method <code>isClosed()</code> has been added.
* <li> When a client is accepted, the corresponding
* connection thread will be created only if the server
* has not been stopped.
* </ul>
* The modifications made to this class in version 2.3 are:
* <ul>
* <li> An instance variable refering to the current connection
* factory. Refer to null value by default, in this case regular
* <code>ConnectionToClient</code> instances are created as in the
* previous versions. 
* <li> Method <code>setConnectionFactory()</code> has been added.
* <li> In the run method, a call to the connection factory
* is made if such a factory is available.  
* <li> Method <code>handleMessageFromClient</code> is not always
* called depending on the value returned by the 
* <code>handleMessageFromClient</code> of the <code>ConnectionToClient</code>
* class.
* <li> The <code>clientException</code> method is still the one called when
* an exception is thrown when handling the connection with one client. However
* <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> and <code>RuntimeException</code> instances
* can now be received.  
* <li> The call to <code>serverStopped()</code> has been moved in 
* the <code>run</code> method.
* <li> Method <code>isListening()</code> has been modified.
* <li> Instance variable <code>readToStop</code> is now initialized to <code>true</code>
* </ul><p>
