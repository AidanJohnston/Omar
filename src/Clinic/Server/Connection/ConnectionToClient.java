/**
* An instance of this class is created by the server when a client
* connects. It accepts messages coming from the client and is
* responsible for sending data to the client since the socket is
* private to this class. The AbstractServer contains a set of
* instances of this class and is responsible for adding and deleting
* them.<p>
*
* Several public service methods are provided to applications that use
* this framework, and several hook methods are also available<p>
*
* The modifications made to this class in version 2.2 are:
 * * <ul>
 * * <li> A new hook method called <code>handleMessageFromClient()</code>
 * * has been added. It allows to handle messages inside the client
 * * thread when possible.
* <li> Constructor is now protected.
* <li> Method <code>sendToClient()</code> is not
* declared final anymore. This allows user of the
* framework to override it, perhaps to perform some
* filtering before sending the message to the client.
* However, any overriden version of this method
* should include a call to the original one.
* <li> A test is made before calling the
* <code>handleMessageFromClient</code> method such that
* when <code>closeConnection</code> returns, it
* is garanteed that no new messages will be handled.
* </ul>
* The modifications made to this class in version 2.31 are:
* <ul>
* <li> The <code>run()</code> method now calls the <code>clientException</code> 
* server callback when an object of unknown class is received from the input stream
* or when the message handler throw a <code>RuntimeException</code>
* <li> The <code>clientDisconnected</code> callback might be called after
* <code>clientException</code> if the exception causes the end of te thread.
* <li> The call to <code>clientDisconnected</code> has been moved from
* <code>close</code> to <code>run</code> method to garantee
* that connection is really closed when this callback is called.
* </ul><p>
